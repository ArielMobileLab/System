Inputs:
Simulation Data

Currently includes simulation time

Supports any custom data stream from the simulation

Speech Conditions

A configurable mapping between simulation states and avatar responses (what the avatar says for each condition)

Avatar Video Assets

Pre-rendered videos or animations of the avatar (used for lip-sync and visual expression)

Output:
A real-time avatar that speaks and visually responds to simulation conditions
