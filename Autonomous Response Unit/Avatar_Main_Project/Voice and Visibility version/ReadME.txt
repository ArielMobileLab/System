üó£Ô∏è Talking Avatar 

This project simulates a visual character (avatar) that responds to real-time simulation events and speaks in Hebrew using Text-to-Speech technology.
The system displays an animated avatar on screen and plays speech audio generated with gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), based on data received over from simulation source.
‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:

    UDP communication to receive simulation time from Carla simulation

    Pygame-based UI for displaying the avatar and video playback.

    Hebrew speech synthesis using gTTS

    Trigger rules based on simulation time (speaking  every 10 seconds).
